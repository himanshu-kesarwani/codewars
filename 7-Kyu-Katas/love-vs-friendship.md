## Love vs friendship.

If ã€€`a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26`

Then `l + o + v + e = 54`

and `f + r + i + e + n + d + s + h + i + p = 108`

So `friendship` is twice as strong as `love` :-)

Your task is to write a function which calculates the value of a word based off the sum of the alphabet positions of its characters.

The input will always be made of only lowercase letters and will never be empty.

### Solution

```javascript
const wordsToMarks = (string) => {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    sum += string.charCodeAt(i) - 96;
  }
  return sum;
};
```
